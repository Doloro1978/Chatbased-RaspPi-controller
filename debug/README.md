# Debug module

## What is the debug module?

The debug module is a simple solution to testing the code that you write before submission.

### Steps:
- Write your code 
- Run all the relevant checks from debug scripts
- If the code passes all the checks and the logic makes sense, submit a pull request
- Owner will view pull request, run the code to double check 
- (Potentially) new code will be submitted to main branch
